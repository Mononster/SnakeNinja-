					SnakeNinja!!!!!!

Over 200+ design hours, finally finished my first java 2D desktop game!!!!

Development Environment: 
	Linux (Mac OSX EI Capitan).

Java Environment:
	java version "1.8.0_77"
Usage: 
	For linux user type “pwd” in terminal to check if in the directory /~/Snakes349/. 
	If the working directory is the correct one, type “make run” to run the game.
	The default fps is 60, type make FRAME=“#” run, where # is the fps you want to set as, to run the game at that specific frame.
	For the best game effects, enhancements and enjoyment, please use the default fps :P.   
	Alternatively, you can simply click the “Snake.jar” under Snakes349 folder.


Overall Design:

	The actual implementation of the snake game did not take me too much time, I spent most of the time on implementing the game UI. The main theme about the snake game is the colourful frog ;), the dancing speed of the frog is related to the actual speed of the snake, which you can set up in the Menu UI page.

	There are three modes for the game,which are “adventure”, “arcade” and “classic” modes. In adventure mode, the player needs to control the snake to score enough points in given time in oder to move on to the next level. Whenever the player won a level, he could buy items that have special abilities that would benefit the player in the next levels. This mode consists of 5 levels in total, once the player passed all the level, a colourful frog will appear ;).

	In arcade mode, where the player has 60 seconds to score as many points as he can, if the player collected enough points in given time, the player will have a ‘combo’, more details are introduced in the game instruction scene. Again, if the player reached the maximum ‘combo’, he/she will see some colourful frogs in the game.
Also, in arcade mode, the speed of the snake is set as the max speed, which is rather challenging; Moreover, there is no wall collision in arcade mode.
	
	In classic mode, where is the original snake game coming from, the user can select the speed that he/she wants to play with. No time/goal required to move on.  

	During the design time, I found the hardest part of implementing this game is to actually make good UI design, i.e. create all kinds of button effect (hover,click). And add all kinds of music effects to the buttons and the game snake.

	Also, I created a animated snake at the Menu page, which is meant to display the speed of the game snake. The algorithm I wrote for the animation is not really interesting, which I might think of a new algorithm to implement it in the future.
